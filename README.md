# Voice Enabled Online Code Editor

It is your regular online code editor but with a twist. This code editor also supports voice recognition. Yes! You can now use your voice to dictate commands and get your tasks done.

## It supports - 

HTML, CSS and JavaScipt as of now.

## Instructions - 

You can use it absolutely on any browser to make your code work. However, **if you intend to use the voice recognition feature, you strictly must use Chrome or Chromium-based browsers** since the API used is specifically developed for the above-mentioned browsers and it will result in a point of failure on any other browser. You may also have to update your Chrome if it isn't already.

## Drawbacks -

This website doesn't support the addition of special characters using voice recognition. They are bound to be manually added by the user.
We need to wait until google adds support for punctuations and special characters including but not limited to angular brackets (<>), question mark (?), period (.), semicolon (;) and colon (:).
